Challenge Description: "We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?"

Things we know:
1. ctf player is hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal
2. ctf's email: ctf-player@picoctf.org
Want to know:
1. Find a way in and get that sensitive data
