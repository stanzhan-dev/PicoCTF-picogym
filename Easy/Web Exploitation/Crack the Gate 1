Challenge Description: "We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?"

Things we know:
1. ctf player is hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal
2. ctf's email: ctf-player@picoctf.org
Want to know:
1. Find a way in and get that sensitive data

Hints:
1. Developers sometimes leave notes in the code; but not always in plain text.
2. A common trick is to rotate each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet. --> ROT13 Cipher

What I did/thought process:

Knowing that the ctf player is hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal (the instance we are currently running), first thing I would do is use the inspect element and check the console, debugger, and so on.

In the elements tab, we can see that in the body there is this weird text: "<!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->", and from the looks of it, it has to be a ciphertext. With the hint we can assume that it's a ciphertext created from a ROT13 Cipher.

Using a decoder we decrypted the message to get: "<!-- NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes" -->".
